        Hi my name is Adimchinobi Amaihe and I am a iSchool student majoring in information management and technology, focusing on information security. I once built my own PC, and I am also a pretty decent drummer. I enjoy playing basketball or just going to the gym occasionally, and I also enjoy playing 2K with my friends to pass the time. Some great shows that I have watched recently would have to be Snowfall, and The Umbrella Academy on Netflix. Iâ€™m the only boy my parents had, leaving me with three sisters, one older and two younger, to annoy when I get bored often. I am looking forward to taking this class and learning how to make a website.
